# Master's Thesis
My Master's thesis was on Low-Dimensional Machine Learning Potentials for Molecular Systems. In this project, Gaussian Process Regression was used to create potentials for methane dimers (a test system), which were improved upon through fitting to scaled distances in a Lennard-Jones fashion.

I also made contributions to the librascal software as mentioned in my thesis, which can be found here:

librascal is a machine learning code used to develop potentials for use in Computational Chemistry. More information can be found at the provided link.

This file contains all work related to my Master's thesis, including notebooks, presentations and the thesis itself.
