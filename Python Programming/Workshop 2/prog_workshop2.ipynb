    "*for* loops are more suited when the number of repetitions is known is some form *a priori*, or when we wish to select every element of a list or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "*while* loops are more general, they imply repetition while a specific test yields True. It is important to make sure that the loop body will induce changes that will stop the loop at some stage.\n",

    "With loops, we finish introducing the basic pieces of programming: we have the canvas and brushes, the rest will be the landscape to create the painting. (In reality we could do just with integer numbers, sums, an infinite list, *if* statements, and a loop, but [such machinery](http://planetmath.org/unlimitedregistermachine) would provide a very unsatisfactory programming experience, so Python provides some more functionality for our comfort)."
