    "## Introduction to SMILES notation\n",
    "\n",
    "SMILES stands for **S**implified **M**olecular-**I**nput **L**ine **E**ntry **S**ystem and can be used to describe molecular structures as strings - Dr. Anna Barnard introduced these to you in the CIT lecture last term. We will visualise the 3D structures of SMILES strings using Avogadro today, but we could also use special Python Libaries for Chemistry to do it within our Python Notebook ([RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org/)). SMILES notations can be a useful way to represent molecules as a string of characters rather than a set of coordinates, yet it is simple to convert between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key rules of SMILES codes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Atoms** are represented by their chemical element symbol. For example [Ru]. For elements in typical organic molecules, such as 'C', 'N', 'O', 'Br', 'Cl', 'S', 'P', 'B' etc, you do not need the square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bonds** between aliphatic carbons are assumed to single, unless stated otherwise. Therefore **CC** is a single carbon-carbon, whereas C=C is a double carbon-carbon bond. For a triple bond you use '#'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hydrogen** atoms are automatically accounted for in organic molecules, so you do not need to explicitly include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Aromatic** atoms are written with a small letter - i.e. 'c', 'n', 'o' etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can form **rings** by using numbers to label atoms that are connected. For example CCCCCC is a linear hexane molecule, whereas C1CCCCC1 is a cyclohexane.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can do **branching** with parentheses, for example CC(C)C is 2-methylpropane.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You can assign specific **stereochemistry** around a double bond with \"/\" and \"\\\" characters, e.g. Br/C=C/Br is cis and Br/C=C\\Br is trans. For stereochemistry around a chiral carbon you use '@' and '@@' for opposite enantiomers, include the atoms with stereochemistry in square brackets and you must explicitly type the lightest atom e.g. Cl$\\lbrack$C@@H$\\rbrack$(C)N is this chiral molecule:\n",

    "When the SMILES code is converted to a 3D structure by Avogadro, then a relatively simple algorithm is used to construct the geometry. You saw above how this works ok for simple molecules, but it fails for molecules with more complex 3D structures, such as this macrocylic porous organic imine molecule. What you may also have seen for some of your attempts, is that whilst a sensible geometry is constructed, when you use Auto-Opt it may not necessarily reach what you expect to be the lowest energy conformation for a system. We will revisit this in the next workshop, but for now, consider the two images below. These images are plots of a molecule's potential energy surface; on the left a contour map is shown and on the right a 3D plot is shown. If the initial structure you generate is closest to **local minimum, 1**, then the Auto-Opt tool will minimise the molecule's energy such that you reach the conformation that is the bottom of **local minimum, 1**. That is why with the above SMILES example, you needed to manually manipulate the structure until the Auto-Opt gave a more sensible structure - this is equivalent to trying to reach **global minimum, 2**; in our case the the conformation that is also the conformation in the experimentally reported crystal structure. In computational chemistry, **a lot** of effort is dedicated to the exploration of potential energy surfaces.\n",

The CSD was established in 1965 and is a repository for small molecule organic and metal-organic crystal structures (https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-system/components/CSD/). There are currently over 800,000 structures and this is continually increasing, as it is routine for researchers who are reporting new crystal structures in a journal article to deposit that structure in the CSD. This is an excellent resource, not only for finding the solid state structures of a substance, but also for analysing trends in systems.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    2. \"Author/Journal\" - if you are reading a paper and want to see if a crystal structure was reported for that substance, you can enter information about the journal reference.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. \"Name/Class\" - you can search for a compound name (e.g. hydrazine) or chemical class (e.g. porphyrins).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. \"Elements\" - you can specify that you require certain elements to be in the substance or set other restrictions on the elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. \"Formula\"\n",

You don't need to worry about the 3D geometry of the molecule (or specifying the stereochemistry), but what needs to be correct is the connectivity of the bonding. \n",

If you're stuck, then ask a demonstrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you have the right structure codes in your \"View Results\" tab, use the options on the left to look through different features of the different structures. You can see how the 5 structures come from reports of 5 different journal articles by different authors, that the X-ray crystal structure was solved at different temperatures (in the \"Experimental\" information) and sometimes information like the \"habit\" of the crystals is provided - this is the shape of the crystals themselves (in the \"Crystal\" information).\n",

If you open Mercury again, then in the \"Structure Navigator\" on the right hand side, enter \"THALID\" and it will move to that part of the database. Have a look at how the structures vary. THALID01 is a structure without the atom coordinates (just the cell parameters - the size of the unit cell - were determined), therefore it didn't turn up in your ConQuest search (and is not so interesting to us). THALID11 and THALID03 are pretty much the same - you can see this if you tick the \"Multiple Structures\" box at the bottom of the \"Structure Navigator\" and then select one structure after another - you will see they overlay (although there are small differences in atomic positions). Can you work out which are racemates and which are enantiopure solid state structures?\n",

Double-check you have uploaded all the files as a single zip file - you could check this by redownloading the zip file from Blackboard and opening it to check. If you're still not sure, check with a demonstrator. We will expect the files you've created *as well as* the notebook when we check your uploads."
