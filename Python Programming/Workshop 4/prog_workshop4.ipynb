    "Up to now all our programs have run in their little bubble: they define the variable values they use and after they finish they leave little trace that they were ever run. Things changed a little in the last workshop where we introduced the possibility of the user passing on some information for the program to process. We will go a step further in seeing how we can interact with files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing and interacting with files is a very common way of processing information stored in a computer, and is something that your programs might often do. When we deal with files and our programs go beyond their \"logical bubble\", is when we can start doing some damage: delete information on files, delete files all together, fill up the hard disk, damage your installation (the operating system should actually have safeguards for this). This should not intimidate you, it is just that with power it comes responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will first go over the basic operations on files. Then we will look at a case study of a common case scenario where we want to process a file to extract information in a useful format."

    "In any computer hard-disk there are typically two types of files: text files and binary files. Text files are those you can read with a text editor program (think of Notepad, not Microsoft Word), and do not necessarily contain prose. (If you open this notebook, which has an extension \\*.ipynb, on a text editor you will see that it is text in some form. The Jupyter notebook is a text file.) Binary files on the other end cannot be opened on a text editor, or when they do open they show up as ununderstandable characters. (Picture files like PNG or JPEG, music files like MP3, video files, Word DOC files, are all binary files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only be looking at manipulating text files. Although Python can also manipulate binary files, the caveat of such files is that the programmer needs to know *a priori* how the content of the file is structured, and since one cannot just look at the file on a text editor, this task is harder. Binary files further require knowledge of some low level computer architecture which is beyond the scope of this course. Manipulating text files will however illustrate the process, and most instruments and computer programs are able to write data in some form of text file."
